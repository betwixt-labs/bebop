title: Using a self hosted server
---

## Client setup

In order use a self hosted server with Atuin, you’ll have to set up the `sync_address` in the config file at `~/.config/atuin/config.toml`. See the [config](/configuration/config/#sync_address) page for more details on how to set the `sync_address`.

Alternatively you can set the environment variable `ATUIN_SYNC_ADDRESS` to the correct host ie.: `ATUIN_SYNC_ADDRESS=https://api.atuin.sh`.
