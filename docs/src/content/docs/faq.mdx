## How do I remove the default up arrow binding?

Open your shell config file, find the line containing `atuin init`.

Add `--disable-up-arrow`

EG:

```
eval "$(atuin init zsh --disable-up-arrow)"
```

See [key binding](https://docs.atuin.sh/configuration/key-binding/) for more

## How do I edit a command instead of running it immediately?

Press tab! By default, enter will execute a command, and tab will insert it ready for editing.

You can make `enter` edit a command by putting `enter_accept = false` into your config file (~/.config/atuin/config.toml)

## How do I delete my account?

```
atuin account delete
```

This will delete your account, and all history. 

## I've forgotten my password! How can I reset it?

We don't (yet) have a password reset system, as we don't verify emails. This
may change soon, but in the meantime so long as you're still logged in on at
least one account, it's safe to delete and re-create the account.

We're aware this isn't optimal.
